#### Types of Searching Algorithms

- Linear Search

- Binary Search


## Linear Search

- It is a Sequential Search
- Number of comparisons does no depends on the size of the array (N).
- Time complexity - O(n)
    - The time complexity of the linear search is O(n) because each element in an array is compared only once.
    Where n = size of the array.
    - **Best Case - O(1)**.Only 1 comparison.
    - **Worst Case - O(n)** 

## Binary Search
- It is an **Interval Search**
- It is **Decrease & Conquer** because it decreases the search space in each and every iteration.
- Condition to apply binary search :
    - Data should be in a **monotonic function** (ascending / descending / sorted).
- **Time complexity - O(log n)**
- **Space complexity - O(1)**
